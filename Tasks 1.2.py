#Task 1.2 Basic arithmetric operations.
#Write a function that takes two numbers (in this case 5 and 3)
#Take thier input and return their sum, difference, product and quotient
#Subtraction, multipication and addition were done as well as a summary in print

x, y, name = 5, 3, "Jordan"

result = x + y
print (result)

x, y, name = 5, 3, "Jordan"

result = x - y
print (result)

x, y, name = 5, 3.14, "Jordan"

multiply = x * y 
Divide = x/y 

print("Multiplying", x, "by", y, "gives you", Divide)
